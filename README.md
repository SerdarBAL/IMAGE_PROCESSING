# IMAGE_PROCESSING
This was my first image processing project, where I explored concepts like image representation, histogram analysis, thresholding, and transformations like contrast and brightness adjustments using OpenCV and Matplotlib. It enhanced my coding skills, taught me to analyze image data, and sparked my interest in computer vision and robotics.
